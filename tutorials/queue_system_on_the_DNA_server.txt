alias qstat_all='qstat -f -u "*" -q default 12-cores 12-cores_2 24-cores 16-cores'

The "qstat_all" command can be used to view the state of all queues and processes from all users

# Usefull commands

qstat -u "*" -q <QUEUE_NAME> 		# View the state of a particular queue

# Usefull commands to put in the file to execute

	#!/bin/bash

	#$ -cwd
	#$ -o /dev/null
	#$ -j y
	#$ -S /bin/bash

The shebang (#!/bin/bash) may be redundant. All SGE commands starts with "#$":
	-cwd	Output files goew in the current workingd directory
	-o		STDOUT is redirected to this source 
	-j		Answer yes to all and any questions from the program(s) in the file
	-S		Commands in the file are for bash

# Submitt analysis to the queue system

qsub <FILE_TO_EXECUTE>			# Non interactive analysis
qrsh <FILE_TO_EXECUTE>			# Interactive analysis
qstat							# Creates a fully interactive session. Run your commands as usuall after this.
